## Precision at speed. Pilot in command.

Every agent has a flight profile. Cargo planes carry the operation; fighter jets are built for tight turns. HEAV3NS takes the fighter-jet mission: one focused coding task close to the code—inspect context, make a scoped change, verify it, then hand control back to the developer. The metaphor describes our intended use, not a ranking of other agents.

“Break the sound barrier” is our north star for a shorter path from intent to evidence. It is not a measured speed claim. The [Agent Flight Test](agent-flight-test/README.md) checks selected harness behavior with a deterministic local provider; it does not measure live-model coding ability.

Start with the no-key harness check:

```sh
npm run benchmark:flight
```

Read the [test protocol](agent-flight-test/METHODOLOGY.md) or the [adoption and trust plan](agent-flight-test/LAUNCH-STRATEGY.md).

## 🌟 Why Developers Love It

| What You Get | Why It Helps You Every Day | How Fast & Simple It Is |
|---|---|:---:|
| ⚡ **Local-first workflows** | Keeps selected orchestration and review paths close to the editor; provider and network time remain visible as separate costs. | **Measure with the live baseline** |
| 🔍 **Project-aware search** | Finds files and symbols using the workspace's configured search and perception tools. | **Workspace-dependent** |
| ⏪ **Reviewable recovery** | Checkpoints, previews, and rollback paths help inspect changes before committing them. | **External effects are out of scope** |
| 💸 **Cost-aware context** | Tracks context and cache behavior so users can reason about provider usage. | **No savings promise** |
| 🛡️ **Guarded tools** | Permission and safety layers can inspect commands, paths, and tool requests before execution. | **Policy- and host-dependent** |
| 🚀 **Observable runtime** | Health checks, tests, telemetry, and failure states make behavior easier to inspect. | **Not a reliability warranty** |

### Verify the CLI path

`npm test` runs the CLI-native Mocha unit profile in `.mocharc.cli.json`, then the no-key Agent Flight Test. It keeps host/editor compatibility checks out of the default feedback loop while preserving them as an explicit `npm run test:legacy-host` profile.

## 🎯 What You Get (Everyday Superpowers)

| The Common Problem | How HEAV3NS Solves It | Your Real-World Benefit |
|---|---|---|
| **Accidental bad edits or AI mistakes** | Reviewable Recovery | Inspect diffs and use supported checkpoints or rollback paths; external effects may remain. |
| **Fear of AI breaking working code** | Safe Preview Sandbox | Look over proposed edits visually before anything is saved to your computer. |
| **Searches slowing on big projects** | Workspace-Aware Search | Uses bounded search and perception paths whose behavior depends on the workspace. |
| **Typos in function or variable names** | Typo-Friendly Smart Matching | Finds what you're looking for even if you or the AI misspell the name. |
| **Ghost servers locking a port** | Port Diagnostics | Reports and, where permitted, helps resolve port conflicts; it does not bypass host policy. |
| **Expensive AI bills on long chats** | Context and Cache Telemetry | Exposes context behavior and cache signals; provider pricing and savings vary. |
| **Need a smarter model for hard bugs** | Swap AI Models Mid-Chat | Switch among the active provider's supported routes without losing context; Claude account routes are discovered from Claude Code when available. |
| **Want a custom AI teammate** | Drag & Drop Customization | Drop any notes or script files into a folder to create a personalized AI assistant. |

## 📋 What's New in Plain English

| Feature | What It Means in Everyday Words | Why You'll Love It |
|---|---|---|
| **⚡ Search & review tools (ADR-136)** | • Project-aware search and typo-tolerant matching.<br/>• Port diagnostics subject to host permissions.<br/>• Diff and sandbox review before supported mutations. | **Inspectable workflows whose performance depends on workload and host.** |
| **🧠 Context and cache telemetry (ADR-135)** | • Tracks reusable context and provider-facing cache signals.<br/>• Reports measurements from the configured provider and model.<br/>• Keeps cost estimates separate from provider billing. | **Better visibility into usage; no universal savings claim.** |
